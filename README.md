# MailMe-RW
This is the repository for the rewrite of MailMe.

## Compiling the code
You are more than welcome to compile the code and use publically on your server. Just be advised, 
if anything goes wrong you will not receive any support from the developer unfortunately. To gain any support 
you will need to purchase the plugin. 

The code here may be upstream, behind or up to date. I therefore do not guarantee that the code at the time of download and compile will work.

## Contributing
Contributions are always welcome, whether that be languages, code or bug reports. 
You can contribute to the codebase by creating a branch and then creating a pull request and bug reports can go under
issues.

## Developers
If you're here to use the API be advised, the plugin does not currently have a dedicated API. However, if you use jitpack or any other method you prefer
to depend on the plugin, you can get an instance of the main class and access and modify the majority of the plugin's functionality. 

An API is coming eventually however.
